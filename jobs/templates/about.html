    So you might be wondering...given the many places there are on the Web
    already to look for and advertise jobs, why should you care about 
    <a href="http://jobs.code4lib.org">jobs.code4lib.org</a>? 
    Well, it's different for a few reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
    <a href="http://code4lib.org">code4lib</a> is a niche within a niche: 
    an international community of software developers, designers and 
    architects who happen to work in the cultural heritage sector 
    (libraries, archives, museums, galleries, etc). There are a lot 
    of esoteric tools, projects and people to know. The idea is that 
    <a href="http://jobs.code4lib.org">jobs.code4lib.org</a> can help 
    people get an idea of what kinds of skills and experience are useful 
    to acquire.
    </p>
    <p>
    Arguably <a href="http://jobs.code4lib.org">jobs.code4lib.org</a>
    is even more of an oddity because it doesn't use one of the many
    opensource job software packages, but is itself a piece of custom software 
    called <a href="http://github.com/code4lib/shortimer">shortimer</a>. 
    For several years the 
    <a href="http://dewey.library.nd.edu/mailing-lists/code4lib/">code4lib discussion list</a> 
    has been heavily used as a place to advertise (and find) jobs. 
    <a href="http://github.com/code4lib/shortimer">shortimer</a> basically
    subscribes to the discussion list and looks for job postings to publish
    here. Think of it as a Web amplifier for the jobs on the discussion list.
